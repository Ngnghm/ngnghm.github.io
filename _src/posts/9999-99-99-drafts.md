## Delete?

Ngnghm hadn’t noticed at first this essential transience of all data in Human computer systems.
Any and all of Human data may disappear at any time without notice.
To prevent or mitigate this loss, Humans have to explicitly take extraordinary steps
to save all kinds of data, regularly, with rigorous discipline.
Each bit of data requires its own special steps to save and sometimes much harder to restore
— if by a combination of bad luck yet good preparation some Humans lost their data
but possessed some form of a backup.
And that there exists no imaginable mechanism to restore data in a coherent way
across several software or hardware components,
making the restoration of a simple terminal user’s computer a hard task,
and that of an actual live service a heroic feat.

Moreover, all data was bound to disappear eventually.
Not only hardware, but also software, was often expected to be used until it failed,
with no regular plan to transfer data to a replacement system until it had at least started to fail.
Human applications are written in an extremely fragile way,
where persistence and correctness are considered "non-functional" requirements
and are dealt with as an afterthought — and are thus addressed in a _dys_functional way.

Therefore, it is expected that applications will crash,
have a race condition with other applications, experience plain old bugs,
or be subject to vulnerabilities,
at which point users will irremediably lose configuration or session data,
documents written or data entered.
(Interestingly, while it is all too easy for data you care about to be deleted,
yet it is very hard to make sure that some data you want forgotten is ever completely deleted.)





## Live Upgrade

What happened to your data when you incompatibly modified a program?
Could some guiding principle help predict the answers to these and other questions?

Internal control vs external control:
Schema upgrade is not part of a Human computer system,
but is a modification done from the _outside_ by the Humans.
Schema upgrade is part of the Houyhnhnm computing system (which includes Houyhnhnms as well as computers),
and necessarily happens _inside_ the system
Of course, it is easier to reason about the upgrade from one schema to the next
when in an outside meta-level where each schema version is separately reified as a simple system,
rather than in single level where all versions are reified together in a very elaborate system.
The point is, this meta-level is always part of the overall computing system,
and is be formalized inside the computer part of it than kept informal
and managed manually by the sentients only.

When writing an upgrade operator, you can't implicitly drop the data —
the system uses linear logic to ensure that you have to *explicitly* drop the data.



### Conclusion

We discussed many hours, and eventually found that we could explain
the difference in approaches by a Houyhnhnm comput_ing_ system being a _live system_
based on the premise that the system stays always on
and evolves in internal interaction between machines and programmers,
whereas Human computer systems are [_cult of dead_](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/2950) systems
in programs never change then die taking all their data with them,
change happening as external commands from the programmer above.

By starting from the interactions and looking for general abstractions,
Houyhnhnms are able to provide a general solution
where Humans, starting from their devices and building only up
must implement a large variety of ad hoc tools.

That is because the basic premise of Human computer systems is that
change is external to programs, that it comes from Humans above,
in a one way command-and-obey interaction;
in Human computer systems,
programs are fixed entities that never change,
and any change requires that processes running the old programs must die,
taking all their data with them, to be replaced with new programs.
In other words, Human computer systems are
[_cult of dead_](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/2950) systems.
By contrast, Houyhnhnm computing systems are _live systems_,
where the code is not separate from the data,
but the two evolve together in a two-way interaction
with a Sentient being who isn't above but beside them.
Once again, this basic

Ngnghm was interested in understanding how Human computer systems were or weren't implementing computing domains.
I was more interested in understanding how users of Houyhnhnm computing systems were dealing with a system that never forgot anything.


Humans have many devices that they connect into networks, where bits are copied.
Houyhnhnms have a single system that they subdivide into domains,
between which data is distributed (more like [Urbit](http://moronlab.blogspot.com/2010/01/urbit-functional-programming-from.html)).


Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race. — Calvin Coolidge

(Pure) Functional Programming Claims IRL

Not only does that make Houyhnhnm systems much simpler,
it also guarantees forever interoperability of every single piece data with any future system,
at whichever level of abstraction that data was defined.
If you want your data to remain relevant to your future self, or to be usable by other people, etc.,
you still need to wisely choose suitable algebraic data types,
to organize software into components with clean interfaces,
to pick appropriate policies that lead to suitably performant implementations,
to rely on suitable libraries.


### Houyhnhnms vs Martians

Amongst alien computing systems, one that can be contrasted with Houyhnhnm computing systems
is the Martian [Urbit](http://moronlab.blogspot.fr/2010/01/urbit-functional-programming-from.html).

Houyhnhnm strategies can be contrasted with Urbit _jets_.
Both are meta-level implementation optimizations;
but Urbit jets are a fixed number of strategies built into the system for a fixed language,
whereas new Houyhnhnm strategies can be written by users for any language they want to use.
Urbit is still a "build upwards only" system.

Of course, Urbit has the important advantage that it has working code that is readily available to Humans,
whereas no Human is known to have actually seen a Houyhnhnm computing system, or reimplemented one.
