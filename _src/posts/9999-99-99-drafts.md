## Intros


Conversely, I grew more and more curious of how things were done in Houyhnhnm computing systems
that seemed hard to me while programming Human computer systems;
and as the conversation went on,
I took it as a challenge and as a matter of the Honor of the Human Race to discover things
where Human computer systems would shine in comparison to Houyhnhnm computing systems,
or at least where Houyhnhnm computing systems would suck even more than Human computer systems.

## Ownership

In a swarm of nanobots and wearable devices,
how do you respect the landowner while serving the owner?


### Casual Browsing ###

Persistence: History, forever.

Diff: notification of changes. Suggestions of changes.





### Applications ###

Delivering software as components, not applications (Human closest: browser plugins)

AOP: Modularity in implementation strategies


### Sentient-Computer interface

Failure of UX Design of the programmer experience.

Aspects: search.


### Conclusion

We discussed many hours, and eventually found that we could explain
the difference in approaches by a Houyhnhnm _computing_ system being a _live system_
based on the premise that the system stays always on
and evolves in internal interaction between machines and programmers,
whereas Human computer systems are [_cult of dead_](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/2950) systems
in programs never change then die taking all their data with them,
change happening as external commands from the programmer above.

By starting from the interactions and looking for general abstractions,
Houyhnhnms are able to provide a general solution
where Humans, starting from their devices and building only up
must implement a large variety of ad hoc tools.

That is because the basic premise of Human computer systems is that
change is external to programs, that it comes from Humans above,
in a one way command-and-obey interaction;
in Human computer systems,
programs are fixed entities that never change,
and any change requires that processes running the old programs must die,
taking all their data with them, to be replaced with new programs.
In other words, Human computer systems are
[_cult of dead_](http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/2950) systems.
By contrast, Houyhnhnm computing systems are _live systems_,
where the code is not separate from the data,
but the two evolve together in a two-way interaction
with a Sentient being who isn't above but beside them.




### Bla blah

ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization): symptom of deep problem.
<beach> You take a stupid OS and a stupid programming language vulnerable to attacks.
Instead of fixing them, you patch the thing by adding ASLR.  *boggle*!



Humans have many devices that they connect into networks, where bits are copied.
Houyhnhnms have a single system that they subdivide into domains,
between which data is distributed.


(Pure) Functional Programming Claims IRL
http://logicaltypes.blogspot.com/2015/08/pure-functional-programming-claims-irl.html


Not only does that make Houyhnhnm systems much simpler,
it also guarantees forever interoperability of every single piece data with any future system,
at whichever level of abstraction that data was defined.
If you want your data to remain relevant to your future self, or to be usable by other people, etc.,
you still need to wisely choose suitable algebraic data types,
to organize software into components with clean interfaces,
to pick appropriate policies that lead to suitably performant implementations,
to rely on suitable libraries.


### Houyhnhnms vs Martians

http://urbit.org/preview/~2015.9.25
https://medium.com/@urbit/design-of-a-digital-republic-f2b6b3109902

Amongst alien computing systems, one that can be contrasted with Houyhnhnm computing systems
is the Martian [Urbit](http://moronlab.blogspot.fr/2010/01/urbit-functional-programming-from.html).

Houyhnhnm strategies can be contrasted with Urbit _jets_.
Both are meta-level implementation optimizations;
but Urbit jets are a fixed number of strategies built into the system for a fixed language,
whereas new Houyhnhnm strategies can be written by users for any language they want to use.
Urbit is still a "build upwards only" system.

Of course, Urbit has the important advantage
that it has working code that is readily available to Humans,
whereas no Human is known to have actually seen a Houyhnhnm computing system, or reimplemented one.

Security.
That there is a way to distinguish "normal" and "virtualized" machines from the inside is itself a huge security #FAIL
All software must always run in "virtualized" mode, and any query attempt is a violation that must cause termination.
& a security violation should kill not just one process, but the entire process group, up to the next a secure(r) shell.
Also automatically log an incident, flag the vendor, and trigger a police investigation.
