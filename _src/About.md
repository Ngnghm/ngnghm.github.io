## A TUNES Retrospective

Decades ago, I started the [TUNES project](http://tunes.org/),
to reinvent computing software according to a different _point of view_.
It was ultimately a failure in that the project remained mostly vaporware;
yet it was a success in that it allowed me and many people to learn, exchange,
and initiate each other to unsuspected horizons,
in a community that well predated [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/),
Reddit, or [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/).
Eventually, I decided to join the Software Industry,
that I may learn how to build real commercial software
that actually gets deployed and used — and incidentally earn a better living.
Indeed I did learn a lot on how to build software
— and, more often than not, on
[how _not_ to build software](http://fare.livejournal.com/171998.html).
My initial ambition was that having learned how to build software,
I would apply this knowledge to building TUNES.
Yet, though the dream of TUNES never left me, it moved to the back of my brain
as I trudged through a career in big software companies
while speaking a strangely different conceptual language
from that spoken by most of my colleagues.

In those many years before, during and after the TUNES project,
I have met many people who seem to share my general sense
of how computing systems could be but mostly aren't.
Unhappily, I haven't found a way to have all these good people work together
on a common system that could embody more than what a single person can achieve of these ideas.
Eventually, I decided that the main missing component
was neither talent nor aspiration,
but a clear enough vision of what the common goal should be.
So I decided to write a TUNES Retrospective:
a document explaining what were the significant ideas in TUNES,
which had been implemented successfully in the last 20 years,
which had been tried and failed,
and which were still waiting to be implemented
— but mostly, a document to convey the _point of view_ of TUNES, its _vision_.

Now, I quickly determined that there were too many ideas I wanted to mention
to fit in a short document, especially if I had to do justice to them.
It had to be a series of posts;
and the posts should be weaved with good storytelling to keep the audience interested.

And that's when I met Ngnghm the Houyhnhnm...
