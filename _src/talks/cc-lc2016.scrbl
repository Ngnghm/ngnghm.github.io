Dijkstra once said that
'Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.'
Imagine a world where programmers think not in terms of computers, but in terms of computing.
In that world, programmers and businessmen don't focus on 'finished products';
they focus on development processes and customer interactions.
What counts as cheaper is not a shorter source file and smaller binary
but a shorter interaction loop and a system overall easier to reason about.
There are no 'operating systems' and 'standalone applications';
there are 'interactive platforms' and 'extensions' (just like Emacs, only less antiquated).
There is no painfully serializing data and saving it into file systems or databases,
then painfully getting it back; there is pervasive data persistence.
Virtualization isn't an advanced technique for system administration;
it is a basic programming language feature.
Meta-level programs aren't just arcane static code generation techniques;
they are the regular way programs are built and combined, at runtime as well as compile-time.
A relatively simple switch in how you look at programming will lead to
vastly different conclusions on what software architecture should look like,
on what software development best practices are, on what software business can be.
