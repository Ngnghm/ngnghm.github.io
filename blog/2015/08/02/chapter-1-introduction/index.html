<p><em>Abstract</em></p>

<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>

<p>Decades ago, I started the <a href="http://tunes.org">TUNES project</a>, to reinvent computing software according to a different point of view. It was ultimately a failure in that the project remained mostly vaporware; yet it was a success in that it allowed me and many people to learn, exchange, and initiate each other to unsuspected horizons, in a community that well predated <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, or <a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided to join the Software Industry, that I may learn how to build real commercial software that actually gets deployed and used—and incidentally earn a better living. Indeed I did learn a lot on how to build software—and, more often than not, on how not to build software. My initial ambition was that having learned how to build software, I would apply this knowledge to building TUNES. Yet, though the dream of TUNES never left me, it moved to the back of my brain as I trudged through a career in big software companies while speaking a strangely different conceptual language from that spoken by most of my colleagues.</p>

<h1 id="the-way-houyhnhnms-compute">The Way Houyhnhnms Compute</h1>

<p>Everything changed again when one day, I met a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houyhnhnm">Houyhnhnm</a>. This adventurous creature, whose name was Ngnghm, had heard of a stranger who long ago visited his home country. So the legend said, the traveler, called <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17157/17157-h/17157-h.htm">Gulliver</a>, was a “Human”: a paradoxical creature that looked just like a Yahoo, yet like Houyhnhnms possessed the ability to reason and speak. There were fantastic tales of a planet full of such humans, as attributed to this Gulliver; and the stories went that in the land of humans, there were animals known as “Horses” that looked just like Houyhnhnms, but like Yahoos couldn’t speak any language and were likely not fully sentient. Ngnghm, immensely curious, had embarked on a journey of discovery to find and visit this fantasy land of Humans and Horses, if it existed at all. But while sailing the Sea of Potentiality, his transdimensional ship collided with débris caused by Human (or was it Yahoo) pollution—and he was shipwrecked. Now he was stranded onto our plane of existence. Not being able to communicate in human language, he was initially mistaken for an old horse; and he had but narrowly escaped being sent to the knacker—or worse, a government research facility.</p>

<p>When I met him, Ngnghm had already learned to read and write our language. He was desperately looking for parts to build a new ship, so that he may some day sail back home. Since I know nothing of transdimensional travel, I instead showed him how to use the Internet to find all the support that mankind could offer him. He was stupefied by how similar yet how different our human computing systems were from those of the Houyhnhnms; in some way, ours were so much more advanced, yet in other ways they were so desperately primitive. And as he was telling me of how Computing was done amongst Houyhnhnms, I was suddenly reminded of my own old dreams. Now I had found a clearer vision of a world I was yearning for—a world I felt like I had lost, though I never had it—and a world that was within reach if only I could build a suitable ship, to sail the Sea of Potentiality and reach the mysterious and enticing land of Houyhnhnm computing.</p>

<h1 id="a-different-point-of-view">A Different Point of View</h1>

<p>The fundamental difference between Human computer systems and Houyhnhnm computing systems is one of point of view. Houyhnhnms do not possess a different kind of logic, nor mathematics, nor physics; though they have discovered how to travel through many dimensions, they do not have quantum computers, logical oracles, or any magic means of computation beyond our own capabilities. But they approach computing in a way that is foreign to us Humans, and that leads to very different results.</p>

<p>Whereas Humans view computers as tools below them to which they give orders and that do their bidding, Houyhnhnms view computing as an interaction within a system around them that extends their consciousness. Humans view programs as blueprints to build artefacts in a separate and simpler universe of software and hardware. Houyhnhnms view programming as a conversation involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)">wetware</a> first, and only accessorily the synthetic phenomena they induce (a.k.a. computing devices). Humans articulate their plans primarily in terms of logical and physical devices. Houyhnhnms weave their conversations foremost around the automation of interactions in the ontologies they are interested in—including those of other such conversations.</p>

<p>You may dismiss all this as dreamy philosophy, empty words without any consequences—I certainly did so at first. Yet the difference in point of view that I am now attempting to distill leads to systems that are organized in very different ways, that are optimized for very different metrics, and that engage users in very different processes, with role delineations according to very different criteria, resulting in a very different variety of artefacts of very different sizes.</p>

<h1 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h1>

<p>For instance, when Ngnghm discovered that, like him in his world, I was trained in programming, he asked me to demonstrate some Human computing systems, starting with the the simplest I could find. So I showed him simple programs I was writing in C: a relatively simple programming language with a somewhat familiar syntax and well defined enough formal semantics, but nevertheless a universal programming language capable of doing everything. Yet, after he painfully assimilated what I showed him, struggling all the way, he told me that no, I was obviously not programming in C, and indeed that I couldn’t possibly, because C was not a universal programming system at all, but could do next to nothing, and only very inefficiently so; instead, I was programming in C, plus an IDE, plus an Operating System, plus libraries, that all together constituted a very large system with incredibly complex formal semantics; and what more, a large part of the interaction between these components depended on a large number of completely informal semi-conventions about how the filesystem was or wasn’t used by which process, and how these system and user processes themselves were managed. What to Humans looked simple because our point of view focuses on some aspects and neglects others, to the Houyhnhnms was an unmanaged and unmanageable mess because they see things from a different angle.</p>

<p>Instead, what Houyhnhnms considered to be a simple system was one that has a short description when you take into account the entire software toolchain, including the compiler, interactive editor, formal verification tools, libraries, operating system, drivers, hardware blueprints, etc., and including the informal conventions used by isolated or cooperating users, or the chaotic lack thereof. C, because its underlying development environment necessitated huge and largely informal support structures, constituted a very complex computing system, even though it looked small and simple once the support system was assumed. Functional programming languages like ML or Haskell yield much simpler systems if you take into account the verification tools and the development process; yet still neglected entire swaths of what makes a complete computing system, such as IDE, Operating System, persistent storage usage conventions, schema upgrade, etc., and so they ended up being overall still pretty complex.</p>

<p>By Houyhnhnm standards, the simplest human computing systems, though far from ideal, would be more like Smalltalk or the systems built by Alan Kay’s ViewPoint Research Institute, where the description for the entire system, including compiler, IDE, libraries, operating system, drivers, interactive graphical environment, font rendering, etc., all fit in a few tens of thousands of lines of code. Note that FORTH has been used to build complete systems of even smaller overall software size; but being low-level, FORTH relies more on informal design patterns and manually enforced limitations, which according to the Houyhnhnms make the resulting system overall more complex, especially so if multiple people are supposed to work on the same system. In any case, a change in point of view led to a completely different metric to judge the simplicity of programming systems. Just as it would change how to judge other qualities of computing systems in general.</p>
